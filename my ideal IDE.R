### The Ideal IDE
## Audience of 1 - Tareef at Posit

# Introduction

As a programmer,



# 1.  The three pillars of data science: SAS, R, Python
# 2.  The IDEs:  SAS enterprise, Rstudio, Jupyter/VSCode
# 3.  The strengths of each:
# SAS - data management and cleaning
# R - modeling, data visualization, statistics, reporting
# Python - web scraping, machine learning, deep learning

How do we manage these three workflows?  The answer is to use the right tool for the right job, but this involves multiple data types, IDEs,

# My ideal IDE: SAS + R + python, all in one window.
# Currently Posit provides R and Python
# I would like to add SAS to the mix
# Make some vague suggestion that Microsoft could incorporate this into VSCode.
"Somebody is going to do this"
"We are considering doing this ourselves, we are at Rstats NYC, come talk to me about the ideas"


# AI is useful for data cleaning, but not for data analysis
